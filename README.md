# Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

The assignment was to create a daily planner that is color responsive to the past, present and future by utilizing moment.js. The assignment was very difficult for me especially moment and making my page functional. After I started adding bootstrap elements I completely destroyed my table and with a combination of help from my classmates, tutor, and a TA I finally got it somewhat together and functional.

Months later... haha. I'm much better at jquery and yet this Frankenstein was a lot of work for me. I incorporated a dad joke api, removed the local storage component, and added then added dynamic content to change based on the day of the week.
