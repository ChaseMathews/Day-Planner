# HW-Planner
# Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

The assignment was to create a daily planner that saves hourly input that is color responsive to the past, present and future. Utilizing 'localStorage' and moment.js. The assignment was very difficult for me especially moment and making my page functional. After I started adding bootstrap elements I completely destroyed my table and with a combination of help from my classmates, tutor, and a TA I finally got it somewhat together and functional.
